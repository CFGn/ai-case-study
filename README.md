# Healtcare industry is revolutionize by the AI

## Overview and Origin

* Company name: insitro

* Company was founded in 2018 in California, USA.

* Daphne Koller and a number of founding investors started the company: Arch Venture Partners, Andreessen.Horowitz (a16z), Foresite Capital, GV, Third Rock Venures.

* Daphne Koller, a longtime ML resercher for over 25 years, come to ideea of rethinking drug discovery using machine learning.

* Company is funded by investors. Not only those mentioned above but also: BlackRock, CPP Investments (Canada Pension Plan Investment Board), Casdin Capital, HOF Capital, funds and accounts advised by Softbank Investment Advisors, T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc., Temasek, Two Sigma Ventures, and WuXi AppTec's Corporate Venture Fund
A Series C financing round raised $400 millions on March 15, 2021.
$143 million raised in series B financing on May 26, 2020.

## Business Activities

* Company is an AI-driven drug discovery and development through the application of machine learning 

* The company's intended customer are drug manufacturers and heathcare providers.

* As solution, the company leverage the tools of modern biology to generate high-quality, large data sets optimized for machine learning. Company "invest heavily in the creation of our own datasets using high throughput experimental approaches, datasets that are designed explicitly with machine learning in mind from the very start". Also, it combine "deeply experienced biologists and drug hunters" working with "leading edge technologists and machine learners".


## Landscape

* Company activate in healthcare industry, a multi-billion global one. There is a transformation underway in healthcare due to the adoption of disruptive technologies.


* Among other major companies in this field we found: Arterys, Butterfly Network, Caption Health, Olive AI, Babylon Health, Owkin, Cleerly, DeepMind (in partner with hospitals).

## Recommendations

* Use of the multimodal patient data to capture the heterogeneity of disease, like Owkin does. Also, if data is local than one ideea, by the same Owkin, is to build models locally without pooling data.

* This will increase the data available for ML resulting more robust and accurate models, will accelerate the development.

* Train machine learning models on distributed datasets, will be the technology need it. Obvious, reason been to avoid pooling data in one location.
